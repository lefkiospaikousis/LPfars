# LPfars

The goal of LPfars is to plot the density of fatal injuries on a map

## Installation

You can install the released version of LPfars from
[Github](https://github.com/lefkiospaikousis/LPfars) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("lefkiospaikousis/LPfars")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
## basic example code
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
